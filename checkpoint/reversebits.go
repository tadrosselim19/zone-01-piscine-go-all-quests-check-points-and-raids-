/*
1. Shifting result to the left makes room for the new bit
by moving all bits one position to the left.
2. AND-ing oct with 1 (oct & 1) isolates the right-most bit
of oct.
3. OR-ing this bit with result adds the bit to the right-most
position of result.
4. Shifting oct to the right (oct >> 1) prepares the next
bit for processing in the next iteration.

The function essentially builds the reversed binary
number one bit at a time, shifting result to make room
for the next bit and extracting each bit from oct
starting from the right.
